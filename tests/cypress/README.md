# Cypress Testing

This contains a very basic cypress testing example.

To install:

```bash
npm i
export CYPRESS_BASE_URL="http://yourcurrenturl.ddev.site"
```

To run, either:

* ``cypress open`` (opens editor)
* ``node_modules/.bin/cypress open`` (if you don't have cypress globally)
* ``cypress run`` (run's without UI)
* ``npm test`` (same as above)
