# Promet Starter Repository

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/promet/d8_starter.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/promet/d8_starter)

The goal for this project is to be a "starter" project for Promet Projects.

This project emphasizes:

* Easy project setup
* Easy test setup
* Commands for asset creation and deployment

This is a work in progress.

## Similar projects

* [Octane-CI](https://github.com/phase2/octane-ci)
* [Drupal Starter](https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-starter)

## Setting up

1. Install [docksal](https://docksal.io/)
2. ``fin init``

OR

1. Install [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
2. ``ddev start``
3. ``ddev init``

## Testing

Tests are in `/tests` folder.

### Behat

Run ``fin/ddev behat``

### Pa11y

Run ``fin/ddev pa11y``

### Cypress

Currently there is not a container for cypress. This will make it easier to use locally. To install cypress: ``cd tests/cypress; npm i``.

To run cypress tests: ``cd tests/cypress; node_modules/.bin/cypress open`` to open the interactive test runner or ``cd tests/cypress; node_modules/.bin/cypress run`` to run all tests.

### PHP Unit

Coming soon.

## Theme

There is a starter theme for setup and testing. It is recommended to [install a new theme](https://docs.emulsify.info/installation/design-system).

To build the theme assets:

``ddev/fin build-theme``

To run storybook:

``ddev/fin storybook``

## Fixtures

This project uses [Entity staging](http://drupal.org/project/entity_staging) for fixtures. The fixtures are used for tests as well as test content. To install the fixtures run:

``fin/ddev test-content``
